Opening provided powerpoint in libre office, we can see the masterminds plan. There no hidden content in the slide, or macros.

Onto document properties:

Looking at this is a bit of guessing, but as we just looked at juletyvens plan, i would guess the flag is

NC3{Juletyvens_plan}
```

But i don't remember if this was the correct flag.
